# PyMujoco
Generate Model for Mujoco from MATLAB
# Introduction
> MuJoCo is a physics engine aiming to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, and other areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed. It offers a unique combination of speed, accuracy and modeling power, yet it is not merely a better simulator. Instead it is the first full-featured simulator designed from the ground up for the purpose of model-based optimization, and in particular optimization through contacts. MuJoCo makes it possible to scale up computationally-intensive techniques such optimal control, physically-consistent state estimation, system identification and automated mechanism design, and apply them to complex dynamical systems in contact-rich behaviors
# Getting started
```
pip install pyh
```
Then substitude **~\Lib\site-package\pyh.py** with pyh.py in this Repo. The .mat file should contain the _Node matrix_ and _connectivity matrix_ with name N, C_b, C_s
